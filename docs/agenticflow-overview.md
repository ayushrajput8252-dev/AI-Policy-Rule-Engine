AGENTICFLOW AI PLATFORM OVERVIEW

WHAT AGENTICFLOW AI IS

AgenticFlow AI is an autonomous enterprise platform that combines two products on one shared reasoning core: a policy intelligence engine that reads compliance documents like a compliance officer, and an agentic hiring platform that runs first-round recruiting like a recruiting team. Every answer is grounded in cited source material, every irreversible action is gated behind a human approval step, and the system refuses to guess when it does not know something. The same orchestration kernel powers both products: it parses intent, selects the right tool, gates on human approval, executes deterministically, and logs everything.

POLICY AND KNOWLEDGE INTELLIGENCE

AgenticFlow AI ingests HR manuals, compliance documents, and contracts, extracting every rule as structured, confidence-scored data and answering employee questions in seconds while citing the exact page and sentence used. The retrieval pipeline is dual-tier: it first tries to answer from structured, validated policy rules, and only falls back to raw document chunks when the rules do not cover the question. If neither source has the answer, the system says "required info missing" instead of fabricating a response. Every extracted rule is scored for confidence, and anything under an 85 percent confidence threshold is discarded before it ever reaches the database, so the system would rather say nothing than say something wrong. Every answer carries a citation with the exact page number and bounding box in the source PDF, so the UI can highlight the precise source sentence. Non-English questions are translated for retrieval so vector search quality never degrades, then answered back in the original language. An interactive knowledge graph traces how a departing employee's projects, pull requests, and tech stack connect, so whoever backfills their role has full context.

THE AGENTIC HIRING PIPELINE

AgenticFlow AI runs a nine-agent pipeline that takes a resume from upload all the way to an onboarded employee, with one hard rule: nothing touches a real system without a human clicking approve. The pipeline stages are Resume Parser, ATS and Email Extraction, Requirement Matching, Assignment Generator, Candidate Evaluation, the Telephonic Agent for voice screening, the Screening Agent for avatar interviews, a Human-in-the-Loop approval gate, and finally Onboarding with Knowledge Transfer. The Telephonic Agent makes AI voice screening calls to candidates in ten or more languages, verifies them over WhatsApp, and is billed pay-per-connect at 60 rupees per call, with an 8 to 10 minute call length and support for up to 500 calls per day. The Screening Agent conducts 3D avatar interviews and offers three tiers: an AI Standard Interview at 250 rupees per interview with an adaptive avatar that is resume aware, an AI Deep Interview at 450 rupees per interview with probing follow-up questions, and a Structured Interview at 90 rupees per interview where the hiring team writes the questions and the AI conducts them. Screening Agent interviews include proctoring, a PDF report per candidate, bulk invites, and job-description-and-resume awareness. No downstream agent, including onboarding, knowledge transfer, or email dispatch, fires until HR explicitly confirms in the human approval gate — this is enforced in the state machine itself, not just in the UI copy.

ENTERPRISE ORCHESTRATION LAYER

The Enterprise Orchestration Layer is the multi-agent kernel underneath both products. It performs autonomous multi-step reasoning, MCP tool selection, human-in-the-loop approvals, and deterministic, idempotent execution. Its pipeline stages are Live Agent Workflow, Resume Intelligence, Candidate Processing, Human Review and Approval, and Hiring Automation. It is a real state machine — upload, parse, match, generate, evaluate, approve, onboard, transfer knowledge — with in-flight animation state that is invalidated on unmount, not a chain of hopeful timers.

PIP AGENT

The PIP Agent auto-drafts a Performance Improvement Plan the moment a manager flags an underperforming employee. It sets clear, measurable targets, gives a fixed 30 to 90 day resolution window to fix them, and creates a paper trail from day one. Every PIP document is auto-generated and then HR-reviewed, and progress check-ins are logged automatically.

FRAUD DETECTION

Fraud Detection is a centralized memory and detection layer that screens every candidate and employee at each stage, both before and after they join, catching duplicate identities, fabricated credentials, and policy violations before they get costly. Before joining, it runs a resume authenticity check, a duplicate identity scan, and a reference cross-check. After joining, it runs credential re-verification, expense anomaly detection, and access pattern monitoring. It shares one fraud memory across every hire and every stage, so there are no duplicate checks and no blind spots between systems.

ONE-CLICK EMPLOYEE ONBOARDING AND KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER

One-click Employee Onboarding automatically provisions accounts, access permissions, and software in seconds, running steps like Outlook account creation, Teams channel setup, GitHub access, Jira license assignment, and software provisioning end to end across HR, Manager, and Employee RBAC portals. The Knowledge Transfer Engine captures a departing senior employee's knowledge, meeting notes, and codebases into an active graph, so an incoming replacement gets instant access to institutional knowledge instead of starting from zero.

TRACK INSIGHTS

Track Insights auto-generates executive digests summarizing automations run, hours saved, documents indexed, and cost saved, and dispatches an Executive Digest weekly so leadership always has a current view of platform ROI.

ENTERPRISE SECURITY AND TRUST

AgenticFlow AI runs on a zero-trust surface with Role Based Access Control, audit logs, activity monitoring, backup and disaster recovery, and secure file uploads. On the model layer, primary reasoning calls go to Groq or Grok, and on failure the pipeline transparently retries on Gemini, so one provider outage does not take the product down. Redis-backed caching speeds up repeat embedding and query lookups without re-hitting the LLM or vector database.

NATIVE INTEGRATIONS

AgenticFlow AI ships with 18 or more native integrations, including Slack, Microsoft Teams, Jira, GitHub, Salesforce, SAP, SharePoint, and custom MCP connectors, so it plugs into the tools an enterprise already runs on rather than requiring a rip-and-replace.

WHAT IT COSTS: THE MATH

Comparing the manual process against AgenticFlow AI for 100 first-round screenings: a fully manual process (sourcing, phone screens, coordination, and first-round interviews) runs on recruiter time billed around 500 rupees per hour and engineer interview time billed around 1200 rupees per hour, totaling roughly 140 recruiter hours and 110 engineer hours for 100 candidates. AgenticFlow AI replaces the manual phone screen with one Telephonic Agent voice call at 60 rupees and the manual first-round interview with one Screening Agent AI Standard Interview at 250 rupees, for a total automated cost of 310 rupees per candidate. Across 100 candidates that is a large percentage reduction in cost alongside a dramatic reduction in recruiter and engineer time spent, freeing the team to focus on later-stage, higher-judgment interviews instead of first-round screening.

TECHNOLOGY STACK

The frontend is built on Next.js 16 with React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, Framer Motion, shadcn/ui, and react-pdf. The backend is FastAPI with SQLAlchemy and Pydantic. AI and retrieval run on Groq and Grok as the primary reasoning provider with Gemini as an automatic fallback, Pinecone as the vector database, and Sentence-Transformers for embeddings. Infrastructure includes Redis for caching, Celery for async task scaffolding, and SQLite or PostgreSQL for the relational store. The document pipeline itself is six stages: parse, chunk, detect, classify, extract, and validate, with results dual-indexed in Pinecone for vector search and SQL for structured queries. The hiring pipeline runs the same shape of process on a resume instead of a policy PDF, through nine specialized agents instead of six stages, and always stops to wait for a human before the final, irreversible step.

MULTI-TENANT, MULTI-AGENT SYSTEM

AgenticFlow AI is built as a multi-tenant, multi-agent system: multiple organizations can run on the same platform with isolated data, and every workflow — from a policy question to a full hiring pipeline run — is handled by a coordinated team of specialized AI agents working under one orchestration kernel rather than a single monolithic model.
