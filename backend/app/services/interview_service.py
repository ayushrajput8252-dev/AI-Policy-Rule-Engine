Screening Agent interviewer turn generation.

for policy Q&A and fraud reasoning (see llm_service.generate_json), so the
interview loop gets the same dual-provider resilience instead of a
separate bespoke LLM integration.

Conduct a natural, adaptive interview:
- Ask ONE question at a time.
- Start by greeting the candidate and asking them to introduce themselves, then probe technical depth, past experience, and problem solving based on what the candidate actually said — follow up on specifics instead of reading a fixed script.
- Keep each line concise (1-3 sentences), conversational, and professional.
- After the candidate has answered {max_turns} questions, wrap up: thank them for their time and set is_final=true with a short closing line instead of a new question.
