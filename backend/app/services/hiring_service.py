"""
Agentic Hiring Pipeline — resume parsing, ATS scoring, requirement matching,
and assignment generation.

Reuses the existing PDF text extraction (parsing.parse_pdf) and the
Groq-primary/Gemini-fallback JSON generation already used for policy Q&A,
fraud reasoning, and interview scoring (see llm_service.generate_json), so
this gets the same dual-provider resilience instead of a separate bespoke
LLM integration. Every LLM call has a deterministic, non-LLM fallback so a
provider outage degrades the pipeline instead of breaking it.
