One-off ingestion script: pushes docs/agenticflow-overview.md through the exact
same pipeline a PDF upload goes through (chunk -> store in SQL -> embed +
upsert into Pinecone -> LLM rule extraction), so the assistant can answer
questions about the AgenticFlow AI product itself, not just HR policy PDFs.
